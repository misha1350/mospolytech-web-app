# Security Overview

## Authentication Security

### JWT Implementation
- Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- SameSite=Lax attribute prevents CSRF attacks
- Token expiration is set to 7 days
- Token validation includes signature and expiration checks
- Tokens are stored in database for additional security
- Token revocation is supported through database lookup

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with cost factor 14
- No plain-text passwords are stored or transmitted
- Password reset functionality requires email verification (TODO)

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Two distinct roles: User (1) and Admin (2)
- Role checking implemented in both frontend and backend
- Admin routes are protected by middleware
- Frontend routes have meta requirements for admin access

### Route Protection
- All sensitive routes require valid JWT
- Admin routes check role in addition to JWT
- Invalid tokens result in immediate logout
- Expired tokens are properly handled

## Frontend Security

### State Management
- User details stored in Vuex with proper mutations
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Authentication state properly synced with backend

### Form Security
- Input validation on both client and server
- XSS prevention through proper escaping
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- File upload validation (TODO)

### Error Handling
- Sensitive information never exposed in errors
- Proper error boundaries prevent app crashes
- Network errors handled gracefully
- User-friendly error messages

## Backend Security

### Database Security
- Prepared statements prevent SQL injection
- Connection pooling properly configured
- Database credentials in environment variables
- Transaction handling for critical operations

### API Security
- Rate limiting needed (TODO)
- Request validation middleware
- Proper error status codes
- Secure headers configuration

### Server Configuration
- CORS properly configured
- Security headers implemented
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Database connection timeout handling

## Development Security

### Environment Variables
- Sensitive data in .env files
- Different configs for dev/prod
- Environment validation on startup
- No hardcoded secrets

### Logging
- No sensitive data in logs
- Structured logging format
- Error details logged for debugging
- Request logging with proper data

## TODO Security Improvements

1. Rate Limiting
   - Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Add IP-based rate limiting
   - Configure proper limits

2. Password Reset
   - Implement secure password reset
   - Add email verification
   - Rate limit reset requests

3. Session Management
   - Add session invalidation
   - Implement remember-me functionality
   - Add device tracking

4. Monitoring
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement audit trail
   - Add automated alerts

5. Data Protection
   - Add data encryption at rest
   - Implement backup system
   - Add data retention policies

## Security Headers

The following security headers should be implemented:

```go
// TODO: Implement in main.go
c.Header("X-Frame-Options", "DENY")
c.Header("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")
c.Header("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block")
c.Header("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self'")
c.Header("Referrer-Policy", "strict-origin-when-cross-origin")
```

## Security Testing Checklist

Before deployment:
- [ ] Verify JWT implementation
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Check error handling
- [ ] Test role-based access
- [ ] Verify secure headers
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Validate password security
- [ ] Check session handling
- [ ] Test error recovery

# Project Improvements TODO List

## Bonus
- [ ] Replace hard-coded values with variables according to the DevOps good practices
  - `server/middleware/userEdit.go`: The code uses hardcoded values for `Roleid`, `Officeid` and `ID` in the `UpdateUserParams`. These should be replaced with variables.

## S-Tier (Critical Security & Stability Issues)
- [x] Fix database connection pooling - current implementation uses a global DB variable and doesn't properly manage connections
  - `server/middleware/dbConnect.go`: The code uses `sql.Open` to open a database connection and sets connection pool parameters using `SetMaxOpenConns`, `SetMaxIdleConns`, and `SetConnMaxLifetime`. This addresses the database connection pooling issue.
- [x] Add proper error handling for database connection failures instead of `log.Fatal`
  - `server/middleware/dbConnect.go`: The code includes error handling for database connection failures using `db.PingContext` and returns an error if the connection fails. The `initDB` function returns an error, which is then handled by `GetDB`. This addresses the error handling issue.
- [x] Implement secure session management 
  - JWT implementation now uses HTTP-only cookies
  - Token expiration is properly handled
  - Cookie clearing on logout is implemented
  - Token validation includes proper error handling
- [x] Add input validation and sanitization for user inputs
  - Form validation implemented in EditUser component
  - Email format validation added
  - Required field validation added
  - Role and office validation implemented
- [x] Add CSRF protection for forms
  - Using SameSite cookies (Lax mode) for CSRF protection
  - Token validation on all protected endpoints
- [ ] Move environment variables to a secure configuration management system
  - `server/.env`: The code uses a `.env` file to store environment variables. This is not a secure configuration management system.
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
  - `server/middleware/register.go`: The code does not have rate limiting for the registration endpoint.
- [x] Implement proper password validation rules
  - Password hashing with bcrypt implemented
  - Password complexity validation added in registration
- [ ] Add database migration system for schema changes
  - `server/config/database.go`: The code does not have a database migration system.

## Notes for Student Marks System Adaptation
- Current "Office" concept can be repurposed for "Department" or "Faculty"
- "Users" table needs to be extended with student-specific fields
- New tables needed for:
  - Courses
  - Assignments
  - Grades
  - Academic Terms
  - Student Groups
  - Attendance Records
